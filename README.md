# Diverse Store

WELCOME TO THE WONDERLAND OF THE DIVERSE STORE! 
The amazing e-commerce where we sell absolutely everything!

## Why?

It is actually a front-end test for the Liven company!

## Running

If you know the React basics, then you are basically good to go!
Besides, who wants to deal with all the "Oh but it does run in my machine" hell?
No one!

That's why you can run it with Docker, by simply running:

+ `$ docker-compose up`

For building it with docker, run:

+ `docker-compose up -d --build`

From that point onward, you can access the web app with:
`localhost:3000`

## Usage

The app is pretty simple and self explanatory.

It uses the basic blocks for building React applications:
 + React JS
 + Redux State Management
 + Fetch API Requests
 + React Routing
 + React components and stateless components
 + Docker containerization

The app is pretty simple as it was build within a single day.

It ABSOLUTELY CAN benefit from ~lots~ a few improvements.

It is in the roadmap to add:
+ Better CSS with Tailwind.
+ Better code handling with TypeScript (oh, yes, please!)
+ Webpack bundling
+ Add list items offset and pagination
+ Better code structuring (why sometimes I used _items_ and _products_ to refer to the same object?!)
+ Add unit test for components
